This is a repository for the /r/LearningLinearAlgebra subreddit that will allow us to collaborate on written assignments and serve as the main system for sharing any necessary files. Here, you can find the schedule for the course, relevant links and an overview of how the submission and grading system works. Please direct any questions to the subreddit.

***The Written Work System Overview***

The "Written Work" folder is for submitting and grading your written work, including problem sets and tests. Completing the written work will help users learn the material, encourage participation, and keep the class on track. At the end of the course, each user will have a complete graded collection of their work for future reference which may also serve as proof-of-knowledge in the absence of official accreditation. We will keep this organized by having a sub-directory in this folder for each user.


***Creating your folder***
Create a sub-folder in the "Written work" directory with your username on it. All of your written work will be submitted to this folder. To do so, create a folder on your computer with your username as the folder name. In this folder, create a text file named "grades.txt" - this is where results of your written work will be tracked. Upload this folder to the "Written Work" folder by navigating to that folder and clicking the "Upload files" button. Be sure to upload the entire folder. For a working example, see my folder "half_coda."


***Submitting work***
All work is expected to be done by the end of the day (local time) specified in the syllabus. To submit work, simply navigate to your folder and upload a scanned version of your written work. Name your file accordingly i.e. "ProblemSet1.pdf" or "Exam3.pdf".


***Grading Work***
Every user is expected to grade their self-study partners assignments as well. To grade, simply download your partners file and compare it to the solutions posted in the "Solutions" folder. Create a text file that summarizes the result. For each solution that is not 100% correct, note why it is not given full credit. For solutions that are given full credit, no explanation is necessary. Post this text file into your parter's folder and update their "grades.txt" file. Grading should take place within 3 days after the work has been posted. If this can't be done, discuss with your study partner.
